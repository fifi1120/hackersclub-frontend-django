# The Structure of this Project

## Dir / File 

### Root of the Project
![Root Dir](https://res.cloudinary.com/dn5fmt3xj/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/OB_Assets/ob/HackersClub/ktphsbgn0zcg6jje3rvm)
In this screenshot, you see the root directory of our front-end project:

1. `/node_modules/` - A folder automatically created by Node.js, containing all the dependencies and modules used in our project.
2. `/package-lock.json` - An automatically generated file by NPM, which includes the exact versions of dependencies our project use, ensuring the consistent installation of dependencies.
3. `/package.json` - This file includes all the metadata about our project (like name, version and description), along with the list of dependencies and scripts to run.
4. `/public/` - This folder contains the static resources that can be served directly by the server like images, style sheets, and scripts.
5. `/README.md` - A markdown file which provides a brief overview and instructions about the project. 
6. `/src/` - This folder contains the source code of our project. All of the React components, services, etc., will be housed here.
7. `/tutorials/` - A folder dedicated specifically for project-specific documentation.

## Component Level of this React App
```js
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
This is the `index.js` (above)

```js
  return (
    <UserProvider>
      <Reauthenticate />
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, dispatch }}>
        <div className="App">
          <Router>
            <Routes>
              <Route path="/fullpagetest/" element={<FullPageTest />} />
              <Route path="*" element={<MainLayout />}>
                <Route index element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="home" element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="resources" element={<Resources />} />
                <Route path="community" element={<Community />} />
                <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
                <Route path="posts/:slug" element={<PostDetail />} />
                <Route path="posts/create-post" element={<PostForm />} />
                <Route path="login" element={<Login />} />
                <Route path="register" element={<Register />} />
                <Route path="users/:userId" element={<UserUpdate />} />
                <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
                <Route
                  path="user/forgot-password"
                  element={<ForgotPassword />}
                />
                <Route path="user/reset-password" element={<ResetPassword />} />
              </Route>
            </Routes>
          </Router>
        </div>
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    </UserProvider>
  );
};
```
This is `App.js` 

![component level](https://res.cloudinary.com/dn5fmt3xj/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/OB_Assets/ob/HackersClub/o5ezc4rn20shgom9wyor)

As we mentioned, the `index` is the Entry Point of this application. `App` is the top-level component.
- `UserProvider` wraps all other components inside it. It takes care of user-related state across the whole app, such as login status and user data. It leverages the context API of React to share state and deliver functionality.
- `Reauthenticate` is a component which checks the current authentication status of a user, working on refresh token when access token is expired.
- `ThemeProvider` is responsible for managing the app's theme-related state such as color schemes and other style related contexts across the entire application.
- `Router` is a [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) component that manages routing in the application. This makes it possible to navigate through different parts of the application, giving a sense of multiple pages or views being available. `Routes` and ﻿`Route` components define the routes or paths, these three work together to manage routes of the app.
- `MainLayout` is applied to the majority of the routes, meaning all these routes will follow this core structure and inherit common elements like headers and footers.
- Inside the ﻿`Route` components are different application pages including ﻿`Home`, `﻿Resources`, ﻿`Community`, ﻿`About` and others. When `url` matches one of them, the browser will be navigated to the page.
