## Official Withdrawal Adjustments

Students who officially withdraw, either from a course or from the university, during an academic term will receive a tuition refund based on the policy specified [in the Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/expenses/student-refunds/).
Institutional funds awarded by Northeastern University will be adjusted based on the actual charges incurred during the semester. Funds from federal Title IV programs will be returned to the government according to federal regulations. The federal government Return of Funds Policy
dictates that a student’s eligibility for federal financial aid is determined by the number of days enrolled during the semester. The refund will be calculated from the day the student submits an official notification of withdrawal to the Office of the Registrar.

Tuition credits are granted through the first five weeks of a semester or first four weeks of a half semester, based on the date of the official withdrawal processed by the Office of the Registrar.
Nonattendance does not constitute official withdrawal. Credit policies vary according to the duration of the course. Typical tuition adjustments are made according to the following schedule.
(The end of week three corresponds with the last day to drop a class without a W grade.)
